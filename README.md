You can run specific scenarios if you add the tags parameter

```
./gradlew cucumber -Ptags="@Boca"
```

You can run specific browser (firefox, chrome)

```
./gradlew cucumber -Ptags="@Boca" -Penv=chrome
```

### And coding style tests

* Write the features in the features folder
    * Assign tags to them
    * You can parametrize the scenario using 'Scenario Outline'
* Define your steps in the steps folder
   * Parametrize buttons, fields, inputs so you can easily reuse steps
   * Keep good organization of the files, it' a good idea to have one step file per page
* Create your pages/modules files in the groovy folder
    * Make a good use of the [Page Object pattern](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#page-object-design-pattern)
* To config your drivers edit: GebConfig.groovy 
* For changing cucumber configs edit: env.groovy
